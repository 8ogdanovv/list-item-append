# list-item-append

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to insert a styled `<div>` element into a web page, specifically on the Categories page of the KIKO MILANO website. The inserted `<div>` occupies 2 columns after the 4th product on the page. It adapts its width based on screen size: on narrower screens with 3 columns, it takes up 2/3 of the width, and on mobile devices, it spans the entire width. The `<div>` is styled to resemble the product style, with box-shadow and rounded corners. All CSS styles are generated dynamically using JavaScript.
